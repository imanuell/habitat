We're excited to talk about a new feature in Habitat that we feel will
unlock some more interesting use cases that community members have
been wanting for a while. In this post, we'll talk about _composite
packages_ and how they might help you.

## Background and Use Cases

With the rise of microservice architectures,

## Setup

- assumes a habitat setup and basic working knowledge; if not, please see our docs for more.

## A Sample Composite Package

- use Nell's nodejs app, along with a modified nginx proxy from Chris' posta

## What Composites _Aren't_

- not runtime constructs just yet

- experiment with them, let us know what you think
